## 🧠 New Milestone: Rust Mastery (FFI & Web Backends)

In **2.5 months**, I completed a focused learning and project sprint on **Rust**, achieving:

* Mastery of Rust fundamentals and advanced patterns
* Building and consuming Rust libraries via **FFI** (integrating with C and other languages)
* Developing web backends and services using Rust web frameworks (e.g., Actix, Warp)
* Production-oriented practices: memory-safe, high-performance modules for hybrid backends

This milestone helped me integrate Rust modules into existing projects and leverage its performance and safety for backend services.

## 🌟 Featured Projects

### 💰 FinTally – Money Tracker App + AI Insights

Status: Upgrading

🧩 **Tech:** React + Node.js + Django + MongoDB + Rust  
🧠 **Hybrid backend**: Node.js for fast APIs, Django for data analytics & insights, and Rust modules for high-performance, low-memory operations.

**Highlights:**
* Smart finance manager with recurring transactions, PDF exports, and categorized analytics
* Real-time insights: daily, weekly, and lifetime summaries via Django backend
* **Hybrid architecture**: Node.js + Django + Rust for seamless data sync, performance boosting, and efficient memory usage
* Rust modules integrated for critical paths (e.g. data processing, computation-heavy tasks)
* Pagination & infinite scroll for smooth UX
* **AI Chatbot:** planned integration for smart financial suggestions *(under development)*

### 🏫 CampusVision — Face-based Attendance & Verification (In building)

Status: In building

A campus-level attendance and verification system that blends teacher-managed class data with automated face verification using CCTV.

How it works:
* Teachers or school/college units enter branch and class details through a simple interface (teacher part remains manual and unchanged).
* Students register by showing their face once; the system stores a facial template for verification.
* CCTV systems perform automatic verification when students enter campus/class — attendance is recorded automatically.
* If a student is marked present outside campus (e.g., attempting remote marking), they can submit attendance manually with required details; the system then tracks the student until they reach campus.
* Once the student reaches the campus, CCTV verification takes over and reconciles manual entries.
* A data analytics dashboard provides attendance insights, reports, and visualizations for administrators and teachers.

This project is currently in active development and will be designed to scale across colleges and schools.
